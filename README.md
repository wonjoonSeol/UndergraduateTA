# Undergraduate TA 2019

*FAQ: How do you become an undergraduate TA?*

It's hard. 

You have to compete with PhDs. 
The department will always favor Phds and Masters students over Undergrads.

So it helps to have relevent work experience for the module, great grades (Should be high first or module lecturer really likes you) and of course, luck. I really wanted to do become TA for PEP module this year but despite getting 100% + 3% bonus mark in the module I wasn't able to do it. 

When you are applying for TA position though a [TA managment portal](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christopher.hampson/ta_allocation/login.php) make sure to write compelling supporting statement why you would be suitable TA for such module, similar to your job application.

Dr. Jeroen mentioned during the SSLC meeting that he wants to increase more capable undergraduate TAs so it *might* become easier in future.

For SGTs, my case was extremely rare because the department actually has a policy to only let PhD students lead a class. I believe Dr. Zschaler made an exception for my case.

## Introduction To Artificial Intelligence (4CCS1IAI)
Actually, I wasn't TA for this module but I created mindmap for my own revision which my peers also found it very useful.

[View mind map online here](https://wonjoonseol.github.io/assets/Introduction%20to%20AI/Introduction%20to%20AI.html)

I used **IthoughtX** to create the mindmap (Commercial)
If you have that you will have much better viewing experience by downloading this editable [local file](https://github.com/wonjoonSeol/UndergraduateTA/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20AI/Introduction%20to%20AI.itmz) instead.

## Module selection advice for 3rd ~ MSci year students (2019)

A lot of students have been asking me on my views for 3rd and Msci modules,
I will share it here. 

### Term 1 Optional modules
#### 6CCS3CFL Compilers and Formal Languages

#### 6CCS3COV Computer Vision 

#### 6CCS3AMS Agents and Multi-Agents

I haven't done these modules but here are my thoughts on these:

#### 6CCS3AIN Artificial Intelligence 

### Term 2 Optional modules

#### 6CCS3OME Optimisation Methods

#### 6CCS3BIM Biologically Inspired Methods

#### 6CCS3PRE Pattern Recognition
